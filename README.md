# -Real-Time-Twitter-Based-Natural-Disaster-Detection-System
Engineered a sophisticated system to detect and respond to natural disaster events in real-time by analyzing Twitter data. This project utilizes a machine learning algorithm to differentiate genuine disaster-related tweets from non-disaster content. Key features of the system include:

Disaster Tweet Analysis: Implemented machine learning models to accurately identify disaster-related tweets, minimizing false positives and ensuring reliable detection.
Immediate Notification Mechanism: Designed a notification system that alerts nearby social services within three minutes of disaster tweet verification, facilitating rapid response efforts.
Edge Computing Integration: Employed edge computing solutions to process data locally on user devices, significantly reducing response time and server load, enhancing the efficiency of real-time computations.
This initiative not only showcases my skills in machine learning and data structures but also underscores my ability to deploy practical, impactful technology solutions in emergency management scenarios.
