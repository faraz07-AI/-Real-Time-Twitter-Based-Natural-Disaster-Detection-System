Your neural network model does not need to be highly complex, especially if there are constraints on training resources. Although our class has concentrated on computer vision topics such as image classification, object detection, and image generation, you are welcome to explore other areas, including natural language processing (e.g., machine translation) and time series data prediction (e.g., weather forecasting, stock market prediction).\n","\n","- The project report accounts for 95 points, with a dedicated section for contributions worth 15 points. Undergraduate students automatically receive these 15 points for their contributions. However, to earn these points, graduate students must demonstrate unique contributions. Additionally, there are 5 points available for the project presentation, with the opportunity to earn 10 extra points.\n","\n","- Please ensure that all your code is submitted and that this notebook can be executed without any errors. Failure to do so will result in receiving no points for the code sections.
